# Sentiment-Analysis

## Completion checklists

### P R O J E C T 1 · D E E P L E A R N I N G — C O D E , P A C K A G I N G , T R A C K I N G , V E R S I O N I N G

1- src/ layout with pyproject.toml — pip install -e . works
2- AraBERT or CAMeL-BERT loaded in a class with type hints
3- FastAPI /predict : {text: str} → {label, confidence, model_version}
4- Pydantic rejects empty text — 422 returned, tested with curl
5- /health returns {status: healthy} — used by the Docker healthcheck
6- docker build -t arabic-sentiment . passes; docker compose up starts the service on port 8000

7- README: exactly 3 commands to run on any machine
8- MLflow tracking server running — UI accessible
9- ≥ 5 runs: model_name , lr , batch_size , accuracy , f1_macro
10- MLflow comparison screenshot in /reports/mlflow_comparison.png
11- Best model registered as ArabicSentiment → promoted to Production
12- Labeled dataset tracked with DVC — dvc status shows clean
13- dvc repro reproduces training with the same metrics (± 0.005)
14- GitHub Actions: lint → test → docker build → push on main
15- CI fails if f1_macro drops below baseline — documented in README

### P R O J E C T 2 · L L M / R A G — C O D E , P A C K A G I N G , T R A C K I N G , V E R S I O N I N G

1- BentoML service with batchable=True Runner — bentoml models list shows the model
2- bentoml serve runs /predict at localhost:8000
3- Locust report before optimization in /reports/locust_fastapi.html
4- TensorRT FP16 engine built — committed or documented
5- Locust after TensorRT in /reports/locust_trt.html — p95 in README
6- Batch scoring: ≥ 1,000 samples, output to /data/scoring/output/
7- nginx canary config: weight 5/95 — rollout stages in README
8- Evidently DataDrift report on the latest batch — saved in /reports/
9- PSI computed for text_length and confidence_score features
10- Drift check triggered after every batch scoring run
11- Prometheus exposes the PSI score at /metrics
12- Grafana: ≥ 2 panels (p95 + PSI) — screenshot in README
13- Alert: PSI > 0.25 → notification documented in README
14- 12-layer AraBERT distilled to a 6-layer student — model file committed
15- INT8 ONNX quantization applied — model_int8.onnx committed
16- Benchmark table: original vs distilled vs INT8 (accuracy, p95, size)
17- Final architecture diagram in README covering all 5 sessions
